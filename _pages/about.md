I'm a research scientist at Intel AI working on homomorphic encryption. Most recently I've been working on [nGraph-HE](https://github.com/IntelAI/he-transformer), an open-source framework for deep learning inference on homomorphically encrypted data.

I received my M.S. in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University, and a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech.

# Interests
I enjoy tackling problems at the intersection of mathematics and software engineering. I am currently working on homomorphic encryption and other privacy-preserving machine learning technologies.

I also enjoy learning the nitty gritty details of C++ and optimizing a software development workflow using modern tools such as [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), and [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
