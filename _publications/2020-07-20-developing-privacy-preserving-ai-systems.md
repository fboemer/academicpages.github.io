**Abstract**
Advances in customers' data privacy laws create pressures and pain points across the entire lifecycle of AI products. Working figures such as data scientists and data engineers need to account for the correct use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, and trusted execution environment when they develop, test and deploy products embedding AI models while providing data protection guarantees. In this work, we share the lessons learned during the development of frameworks to aid data scientists and data engineers to map their optimized workloads onto privacy-enhancing technologies seamlessly and correctly.
